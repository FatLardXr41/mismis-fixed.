# mismis-fixed
M-FeD would probably not gave me mismis/boggleshorbie so i just fixed the already leaked version.

# Problems
Crashes alot, randomly

# The Fixes
- AnimStateUpdate (0x8d00) -> (0x8d10) (i think)
- A sig ("C_TF_PlayerResource_GetPlayerConnectionState")

# Credits
- M-FeD
- The person who leaked the old broken dll (not thyraxis/axdwt lol, it was someone else)

# hi mfed
- why are you watching this..ðŸ’€
